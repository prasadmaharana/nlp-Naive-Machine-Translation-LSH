# Naive Machine Translation and LSH

This project demonstrates a simple machine translation system combined with the concept of **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** for efficient approximate nearest neighbor search. The goal is to understand how semantic similarity and hashing techniques can be used together in natural language applications.

## Overview

- Implement a basic machine translation system using sentence embeddings
- Use **Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)** to perform fast similarity search
- Translate sentences by retrieving nearest matches from a bilingual dataset
- Analyze how LSH approximates nearest neighbors in high-dimensional spaces

## Features

- Sentence embedding generation using simple techniques (e.g., bag-of-words, word vectors)
- LSH implementation for high-dimensional approximate search
- Translation via similarity-based sentence retrieval
- Basic evaluation of translation quality
